üèõÔ∏è Jurisdictional Correction and Repository Clarification
Effective Date: July 1, 2025

I, Spencer Southern, founder and lead architect of Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC, am making this public jurisdictional correction statement to clarify the intellectual property declarations related to the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework and any associated works.

In my attempts to create repositories, I acknowledge that I lacked technical familiarity with how GitHub functions and how repositories should be structured for formal intellectual property declarations. In those efforts, I unintentionally used incorrect terminology, misapplied language, and introduced concepts in ways that do not correctly represent the jurisdictional scope, ownership, or technical description of the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework.

In an effort to correct these mistakes, I attempted to revise and add additional information to those repositories. However, I recognize that this approach may have inadvertently introduced further confusion.

‚Üí This statement serves to officially set the record straight:

All prior repositories were created during exploratory, incorrect, or learning phases and do not represent the formal, binding, or authoritative jurisdictional claim of Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢, Reflexive Governance‚Ñ¢, Credential Lifecycle Enforcement Systems‚Ñ¢, or any related intellectual property.
These prior repositories are declared obsolete, non-authoritative, and irrelevant to the intellectual property governance or ownership structure of Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC.
This current repository (or statement) serves as the single authoritative declaration of record.
The intellectual property rights, jurisdictional standing, and sovereign authorship of the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework and all associated works are exclusively vested in Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC.

This statement is made publicly and timestamped to correct the record permanently.

¬© 2025 ‚Äî Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC ‚Äî All Rights Reserved.

This declaration does NOT waive, abandon, or forfeit any sovereign intellectual property rights, authorship, or jurisdictional standing.  
It supersedes prior documents solely for the purpose of correcting jurisdictional structure, eliminating descriptive bottlenecks, and establishing the updated sovereign framework governing this intellectual property.  

Jurisdictional Declaration of Scope Correction:

This repository, its contents, and any derivative descriptions do NOT restrict, reduce, or confine the jurisdictional scope, functional utility, or operational embodiments of the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ protocol, its Reflexive Governance Engines‚Ñ¢, Credential Lifecycle Enforcement Systems‚Ñ¢, or any parent, child, or descendant inventions thereof. Any descriptive language within this repository that references a specific application, example, or use case (e.g., payment systems, ticketing platforms, credential management, AI audits) serves solely as a demonstrative implementation and does NOT constitute a limitation on the full sovereign infrastructure-level architecture of the invention. The Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework is a cross-industry, protocol-agnostic infrastructure for universal data validation, credential lifecycle governance, and machine-speed trust enforcement. 07/01/2025

This declaration supersedes any interpretation that attempts to constrain the invention into a narrow technical field, niche software category, or single-industry use case. All rights, jurisdictional standing, and sovereign authorship remain vested in Spencer Southern | Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC.
