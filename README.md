# 🛡️ Mint-to Logic™ — IP Protection & Timestamp Declaration

This repository serves as an official, timestamped declaration of intellectual property protection for the **Mint-to Logic™ protocol**, its substructures, and applied use cases. It documents a timeline of innovation dating back to:

- 📜 **Earliest concept documentation**: 2005  
- 🗃️ **Digital proof & archival entries**: 2019  
- 📅 **Initial patent filing (provisional)**: April 15th, 2025  
- 🛑 **This repository**: A formal public-facing IP declaration to prevent misappropriation and secure original authorship.

## Purpose

This repository is **not a software codebase** but a protective and strategic disclosure document designed to:

- Establish a permanent timestamp in the public domain
- Guard against IP theft, mimicry, or unauthorized derivative systems
- Provide a reference point for legal recourse or licensing conversations

## Coverage

This declaration covers all primary mechanisms of **Mint-to Logic™**, including but not limited to:

- Mint–Validate–Burn lifecycle
- Reflexive behavioral governance protocols
- Conditional triggers for digital asset expiration
- Real-world validation bridges and dynamic data controls

## Governance

Mint-to Logic™ is currently governed under **Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC**, the originating entity and development incubator. All IP declarations, legal strategy, and early-stage documentation are issued through this parent company.

⚠️ A formal transition of IP rights, licensing authority, and protocol governance is planned for transfer to **Mint-to Logic LLC** (pending registration) to ensure focused development and dedicated corporate protection.
