Jurisdictional Declaration of Scope Correction:

This repository, its contents, and any derivative descriptions do NOT restrict, reduce, or confine the jurisdictional scope, functional utility, or operational embodiments of the Mint-to Logic™ protocol, its Reflexive Governance Engines™, Credential Lifecycle Enforcement Systems™, or any parent, child, or descendant inventions thereof. Any descriptive language within this repository that references a specific application, example, or use case (e.g., payment systems, ticketing platforms, credential management, AI audits) serves solely as a demonstrative implementation and does NOT constitute a limitation on the full sovereign infrastructure-level architecture of the invention. The Mint-to Logic™ framework is a cross-industry, protocol-agnostic infrastructure for universal data validation, credential lifecycle governance, and machine-speed trust enforcement.

This declaration supersedes any interpretation that attempts to constrain the invention into a narrow technical field, niche software category, or single-industry use case. All rights, jurisdictional standing, and sovereign authorship remain vested in Spencer Southern | Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC. 07/01/2025
